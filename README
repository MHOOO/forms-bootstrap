#forms-bootstrap
Forms-Bootstrap is a utility for creating web forms in Clojure using Twitter's Bootstrap CSS. In its current form, it is built to be used with the Noir web framework, Enlive HTML templating, and validation using Sandbar.

## Usage
Supported forms: input (text or password), select dropdown, text area, checkboxes,
radio buttons, inline inputs (several text inputs on one line), file
input, error and success messages.

In a web page, you can use the defform macro with the following fields: 
1. name: This assigns a name to the form element
2. type: Supported types: text, password, checkbox, radio, file. Checkbox and radio can also be inline, ie "radio inline"
3. size: Supported sizes: input-mini, input-small, input-medium, input-large, input-xlarge, input-xxlarge, as well as span1, span2, span3, etc
4. label: What to display next to the form element
5. inputs: A vector of [name1 content1 name2 content2 ...]. Used by
   select, checkbox and radio.
6. rows: Defines the number of rows for a text area
7. text-area-content: A string of default text in a text area
